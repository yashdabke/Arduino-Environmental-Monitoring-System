This code is an Arduino sketch that utilizes the Arduino FreeRTOS library to create three separate tasks for monitoring temperature, humidity, and light levels using various sensors and control components. Here's a short description of the key elements and functionalities in the code:

1. Libraries and Definitions:
   - The code includes necessary libraries such as Arduino_FreeRTOS.h and DHT.h for multitasking and DHT sensor support.
   - It defines pins, constants, and variables for connecting sensors and controlling devices like a relay.

2. Sensor and Device Initialization:
   - It initializes a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor and specifies the analog pin it's connected to.
   - It also initializes pins for a light sensor and a relay.

3. Task Definitions:
   - Three separate tasks are defined: TaskTem for temperature monitoring, TaskHum for humidity monitoring, and TaskLight for light level monitoring.
   - Each task is responsible for reading data from a specific sensor (DHT sensor or light sensor) and printing the data to the serial monitor.

4. Setup Function:
   - Serial communication is initiated at a baud rate of 9600.
   - Tasks are created using xTaskCreate, each with its own name, stack size, and priority.
   - A message is printed to the serial monitor to indicate the code is running.

5. Loop Function:
   - The loop function is left empty because the tasks created will run independently in parallel.

6. Task Functions:
   - `TaskHum` reads humidity data from the DHT sensor and prints it to the serial monitor.
   - `TaskTem` reads temperature data from the DHT sensor and prints it to the serial monitor.
   - `TaskLight` reads light level data from either a digital sensor or an analog sensor (based on the 'digital' variable) and controls a relay accordingly. It also prints the light level to the serial monitor.

Overall, this code demonstrates multitasking capabilities using Arduino FreeRTOS to monitor environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, and light) and control a relay based on the light level detected by the sensors. The tasks run concurrently, allowing for real-time data monitoring and control.
